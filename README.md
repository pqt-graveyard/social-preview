## Welcome

On [April 16th, 2019](https://github.blog/changelog/2019-04-16-repository-social-media-image/) GitHub released repository social media image functionality. Since then it's gone widely unused by small-scale projects and meta data remains the owner (or organization) avatar image instead.

This web app makes it dead simple to put in your username (or organization name) and the repository, then download an image that blends in with the branding of GitHub already. Zero effort and stylish.

## Support this project

Like all good software engineers I accept payments in dollars and _exposure_!

You can pop this bad boy on your repository free of charge. It's a small nod to the work put into this project, and will make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside when I search around and see who might be using a generated social preview on their projects.
